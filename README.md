# Model Details

## Model Description

The developers of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) [write](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html): 

> With T5, we propose reframing all NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text-format where the input and output are always text strings, in contrast to BERT-style models that can only output either a class label or a span of the input. Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.

T5-Base is the checkpoint with 220 million parameters.

# Uses

## Direct Use and Downstream Use

The developers write in a [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) that the model: 

> Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task, including machine translation, document summarization, question answering, and classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis). We can even apply T5 to regression tasks by training it to predict the string representation of a number instead of the number itself.

See the [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) and [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) for further details.

# Training Details

## Training Data

The model is pre-trained on the [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4), which was developed and released in the context of the same [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) as T5.

The model was pre-trained on a on a **multi-task mixture of unsupervised (1.) and supervised tasks (2.)**.
Thereby, the following datasets were being used for (1.) and (2.):

1. **Datasets used for Unsupervised denoising objective**:

## Training Procedure

In their [abstract](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf), the model developers write: 

> In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. 

The framework introduced, the T5 framework, involves a training procedure that brings together the approaches studied in the paper. See the [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) for further details.
