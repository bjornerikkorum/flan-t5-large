# Model Details

## Model Description

The developers of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) [write](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html): 

> With T5, we propose reframing all NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text-format where the input and output are always text strings, in contrast to BERT-style models that can only output either a class label or a span of the input. Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.

T5-Base is the checkpoint with 220 million parameters.

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")

input_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

outputs = model.generate(input_ids)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

# Uses

## Direct Use and Downstream Use

The authors write in [the original paper's model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: 

> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models

See the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.

## Out-of-Scope Use

More information needed.

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The information below in this section are copied from the model's [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):

> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.

## Ethical considerations and risks

> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.

## Known Limitations

> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.

## Sensitive Use:

> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.

# Training Details

## Training Data

The model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):

![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)


## Training Procedure

According to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):

> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.


# Evaluation

## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

The developers evaluated the model on 88 tasks and 10 languages. See the table below for quantitative evaluation:
